# Gimme Music! Music Recommendation Application

## Summary
Generally, people enjoy listening to music. At times, they may get tired of listening to the same songs and music genres. The aim of the developed application is to provide the user with music based on their mood or randomly.

**Keywords:** Music, Recommendation

## 1. Introduction
Listening to music is a hobby for some and an integral part of life for others. In this regard, numerous genres have emerged, with works that appeal to every listener. As individuals listen to pieces they enjoy, they can become happier. However, listening to the same piece repeatedly can lead to boredom. As a result, individuals may want to explore new music or genres. Instead of delving into research to discover new music and genres, getting recommendations in a compact application can fit into the user's preference area. This is why I developed the **Gimme Music!** application. Users can enter the application at any time, receive music recommendations, and exitÂ¹.

## 2. Method
The application's logo was prepared using Adobe XD, and the gif used in the application was sourced from the internet. The application is written in the Java programming language, and SQLite is used as the database.

## 3. Application
The icon of the application has been replaced with the logo I created. The top bar has been removed, and a black theme is used in the application.

When the "Let's Get Started" button in Figure 2 is pressed, a new activity is opened, and the main screen shown in Figure 3 is reached. As shown in Figure 4, the user can use the "Gimme Music!" button by making a selection through the spinner view and bring music based on that feature, or they can also get random music if they wish.

## 5. Conclusion
While I greatly liked the idea of the application, I faced many difficulties in the database section. By resolving the issues in the database section, a very efficient application can be obtained. In fact, the mood selection could be replaced with text input from the user, and recommendations could be made from categorized music with the help of artificial intelligence.
